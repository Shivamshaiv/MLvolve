# MLvolve  

MLvolve is a agent based simulation of AI Research. The goal of the project is to understand how AI research evolves at multiple levels with multiple agents each with a unique set of incentives.The project is built in MESA and Pyro with a Pytorch Backend with visulisations powered by Plotly and GUI with Streamlit.  

To get started you need Python 3.6 or above then simply:
```
git clone https://github.com/Shivamshaiv/MLvolve
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model.py
```
To get started with the GUI, you need <a href = "https://www.streamlit.io/"> Streamlit  </a>:
```
git clone https://github.com/Shivamshaiv/MLvolve
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app_model.py
```
The GUI Webapp looks as under, however it is under development and could have bugs.
